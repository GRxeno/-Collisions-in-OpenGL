A game i made to learn how OpenGL works


We have a window 600x600 with a 100x100x100 transparent cube. The window is called "Collisions" and when you press "esc" it closes.
When the user presses "spacebar" small objects appear in the cube that move freely inside the cube and collide with everything and change direction accordingly.
Inside the cube, at 50x50x50 (center), there is a large sphere that the user can move with the arrow keys. Pressing the "T" key it toggles the spheres texture.
The user using the "wasd" keys can move the camera around to look around the scene.
